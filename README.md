# Operating System Concepts and Practical Exercises

Welcome to my Operating System (OS) Learning Journey repository! This repository serves as a collection of concepts, exercises, and practical examples related to my study of Operating Systems. The content will range from basic OS concepts to advanced system programming, including practical coding exercises to deepen my understanding.

## Overview

This repository contains the following:

- Theoretical concepts and explanations of key Operating System topics.
- Practical code implementations that demonstrate system-level programming techniques.
- Solutions to exercises and hands-on tasks to reinforce learning.
- Gradual progression from basic OS theory to advanced topics like memory management, process scheduling, file systems, and synchronization.
  
## Repository Structure
The repository will evolve as I progress through the learning process. It is divided into units and Letures, each representing a different aspect of OS concepts and practical exercises.

## Folder Structure:

#### 01_Lecture: Operating System Concepts – Why We Need an OS
#### 02_Lecture: Types of Operating Systems
