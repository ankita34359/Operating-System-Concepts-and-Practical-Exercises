# Operating-System-Concepts-and-Practical-Exercises

Welcome to my Operating System (OS) Learning Journey repository! This repository serves as a collection of concepts, exercises, and practical examples related to my study of Operating Systems. The content will range from basic OS concepts to advanced system programming, including practical coding exercises to deepen my understanding.

## Overview

This repository contains the following:

 -Theoretical concepts and explanations of key Operating System topics.
 -Practical code implementations that demonstrate system-level programming techniques.
 -Solutions to exercises and hands-on tasks to reinforce learning.
 -Gradual progression from basic OS theory to advanced topics like memory management, process scheduling, file systems, and synchronization.

## Repository Structure

The repository will evolve as I progress through the learning process. It is divided into units or sections, each representing a different aspect of OS concepts and practical exercises.

Folder Structure:

 - Basics/:
Contains foundational concepts such as the role of an Operating System, types of OS, and basic command-line operations.

 - Processes/:
Includes examples and code related to process management, including process creation, scheduling, and communication.

- Memory Management/:
Covers topics such as paging, segmentation, virtual memory, and memory allocation strategies.

- File Systems/:
Discusses file handling, directory structures, and disk scheduling algorithms.

Concurrency and Synchronization/:
Implements concepts like process synchronization, semaphores, deadlocks, and multithreading.

- Advanced Topics/:
Topics like virtualization, distributed systems, and OS security will be added as I progress.
