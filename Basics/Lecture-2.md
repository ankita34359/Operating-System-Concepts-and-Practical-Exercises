# Types of Operating Systems

Operating Systems (OS) are essential in managing both hardware and software resources on a computer. The goals of an OS include maximizing system performance, optimizing resource allocation, and ensuring process fairness. Below is an in-depth exploration of various types of operating systems, their features, limitations, and use cases.

## Goals of an Operating System

- Maximize CPU Utilization: The operating system aims to ensure that the CPU is always occupied with executing processes, thereby improving overall system efficiency.
- Reduce Process Starvation: The OS minimizes the risk of certain processes being neglected or indefinitely postponed, ensuring equitable access to resources.
- Prioritize Critical Tasks: It ensures that high-priority tasks are executed promptly, especially in time-sensitive applications.

 ## 1. Single-Process Operating System
- Definition: Only one process can execute at a time from the ready queue.
- Example: This is the oldest form of an operating system.
