# Types of Operating Systems

Operating Systems (OS) are essential in managing both hardware and software resources on a computer. The goals of an OS include maximizing system performance, optimizing resource allocation, and ensuring process fairness. Below is an in-depth exploration of various types of operating systems, their features, limitations, and use cases.

## Goals of an Operating System

- Maximize CPU Utilization: The operating system aims to ensure that the CPU is always occupied with executing processes, thereby improving overall system efficiency.
- Reduce Process Starvation: The OS minimizes the risk of certain processes being neglected or indefinitely postponed, ensuring equitable access to resources.
- Prioritize Critical Tasks: It ensures that high-priority tasks are executed promptly, especially in time-sensitive applications.

 ## 1. Single-Process Operating System

### Overview
A Single-Process OS, also known as a Monolithic Operating System, allows only one process to execute at any given time. This type of system was widely used in the early days of computing.

### Key Characteristics
- Single Process Execution: Only one process can be active and execute at any time from the ready queue.
- Oldest OS Model: This is one of the simplest and earliest types of operating systems.
  
### Limitations
- Poor Utilization of CPU: During I/O operations, the CPU remains idle, leading to inefficiency.
- No Parallelism: Only one task can be performed at a time, which reduces overall system productivity.
