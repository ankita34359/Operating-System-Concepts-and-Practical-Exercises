# Operating System Concepts â€“ Why We Need an OS

Welcome to my Operating System (OS) Learning Journey repository! This space documents my understanding of the foundational concepts of Operating Systems, including practical exercises and real-world examples to illustrate key ideas. While this section does not contain code, it explains why an OS is crucial for the efficient functioning of our devices.

# Why Do We Need an Operating System?

Imagine you are using two popular apps on your device, TikTok and PUBG, at the same time. Without an Operating System, these two apps would struggle to share resources like CPU, GPU, memory, and disk space, leading to several problems. Let's explore how the OS solves these problems:

## 1. Efficient Resource Management

- Without an OS: If there were no OS, TikTok might monopolize all the system resources (like CPU, GPU, memory, and disk), leaving nothing for PUBG to use. This means you wouldn't be able to run both apps simultaneously, as one app would completely take over the system.
- With an OS: The OS ensures that resources are divided between apps fairly and efficiently, allowing you to run multiple applications without one blocking or overloading the other.
