# Operating System Concepts – Why We Need an OS

Welcome to my Operating System (OS) Learning Journey repository! This space documents my understanding of the foundational concepts of Operating Systems, including practical exercises and real-world examples to illustrate key ideas. While this section does not contain code, it explains why an OS is crucial for the efficient functioning of our devices.

# Why Do We Need an Operating System?

Imagine you are using two popular apps on your device, TikTok and PUBG, at the same time. Without an Operating System, these two apps would struggle to share resources like CPU, GPU, memory, and disk space, leading to several problems. Let's explore how the OS solves these problems:

## 1. Efficient Resource Management

- Without an OS: If there were no OS, TikTok might monopolize all the system resources (like CPU, GPU, memory, and disk), leaving nothing for PUBG to use. This means you wouldn't be able to run both apps simultaneously, as one app would completely take over the system.
- With an OS: The OS ensures that resources are divided between apps fairly and efficiently, allowing you to run multiple applications without one blocking or overloading the other.

## 2. Memory Management
- Without an OS: Developers would need to write complex code for managing resources and memory within their applications. This would result in large, inefficient applications, violating the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) because every app (like TikTok and PUBG) would have similar memory management code.
- With an OS: The OS handles all the resource and memory management at a system level, so developers don’t have to include it in their apps. This keeps applications lightweight and allows them to run smoothly.

## 3. Isolation and Protection
- Without an OS: TikTok and PUBG would not have clear boundaries for how they use memory. TikTok could accidentally write data into PUBG’s memory space, causing crashes, security issues, or corrupted data.
- With an OS: The OS enforces memory isolation and protection, ensuring that each app has its own dedicated memory space. This prevents one application from interfering with another, making the system more stable and secure.
  
## 4. Simplified Application Development
- Without an OS: Application developers would need to write low-level code to manage system resources (like memory, CPU scheduling, and input/output). This would make the development process much more complicated and error-prone.
- With an OS: Developers can focus on the core functionality of their apps, while the OS takes care of underlying resource management, security, and multitasking.

## What is an Operating System?

An Operating System (OS) is a software layer that sits between the hardware and the user applications. Its primary functions are to manage the system’s resources (CPU, memory, disk, etc.), provide a stable environment for running applications, and ensure the smooth operation of multiple apps simultaneously.

## Key Functions of an OS:

- Resource Management: Allocates and manages hardware resources like CPU, memory, and storage.
- Memory Management: Ensures efficient and secure allocation of memory to each application, preventing interference between apps.
- Process Management: Handles the creation, scheduling, and termination of processes (running programs).
- Security and Protection: Protects system resources and data from unauthorized access or interference.
- User Interface: Provides a way for users to interact with the system, either through command-line interfaces (CLI) or graphical user interfaces (GUI).
